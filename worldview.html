  <p>I have thought a lot about creation and why humans exsist,
  but i've never concluded anything for sure. I don't think that
it is evolution though. I find it hard to
believe the story of Adam and Eve because it just seems so unrealistic.
I guess, I am still indecisive about things. It takes time to grow and I am
still going through that process. :) </p>
