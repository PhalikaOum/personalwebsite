    <li> I spend a lot of time on Tumblr  </li>
    <li> I like listening to music, specifically music in the punk rock and post-hardcore
      genre. The bands that I listen to choose to write their music about
    the deep, dark struggles of life,
    <br>
    which I sincerely appreciate. Nowadays, it is
  hard to find music that stays away from the topic of lust and other worldly pleasures. </li>
